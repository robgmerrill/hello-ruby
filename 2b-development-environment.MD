We need somewhere to write our code. In programming we call this our "development environment".

I don't want to slow down our momentum by going through the steps to make sure that Ruby is installed on your computer. We will want to do that eventually but for now we want to get started programming!

We are going to use the free online text editor. The one I am going to use can be found at https://repl.it 

You have the option to create a free personal account. This will be helpful if you want to be able to refer to all the code you will write during this course.

I would recommend it but it isn't required!

We will then click on the button `+ new repl` playground. 

Following that we will need to choose the programming language we want to use from the dropdown menu, Ruby.

From that point you have the option of naming your repl and describing your repl.

For now, repl.it is a free service.  Sometimes these free services change and if they ever do I'll go ahead and refer to a different free online editor you can get started with. 

However, the videos will reflect using repl.it because of the elaborate process of video/audio editing. 

One other things to pay attention to is that sometimes the user interface changes over time. So repl.it may look slightly different from when this video recorded to the time you actually take the course but there should be no difference in functionality.

So let's started. In our next lesson we are going to print out "Hello Ruby"!
