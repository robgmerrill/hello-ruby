Hello Ruby is not the only Ruby course you should ever take but it should be your first!

Here are a few things you will learn in just the first two hours:
* Ruby expressions
* Ruby variables
* Ruby strings
* Ruby escape sequence in strings
* Ruby method converting strings to numbers
* Ruby numbers
* Ruby math operations and comparisons
* Ruby method converting numbers to strings
* Ruby methods on an object
* Ruby comments
* Ruby "puts" and "print"
* Ruby "gets"
* Ruby input, storage and output
* Ruby string interpolation
* Ruby object inspection with "inspect" and "p" methods
* Ruby conditionals
* Ruby loops - for and while

We will learn about all of these while building our first program! This course teaches you the language of Ruby and then gives you an opportunity to speak, program, in that language.
