In this section we are going to build our first program in Ruby!

You might be thinking:
* I'm not ready for this!
* I just want to focus on learning what Ruby is.
* I don't want just another tutorial where I copy what the instructor is typing and have an impressive project but have no idea what I'm doing!

That makes a lot of sense. In this course we focus on building mini project with the syntax that we are learning. 

Syntax is just another word for language. As we learn something in the Ruby programming language we want to quickly start to use it so we can see why it is valuable and have it in our toolbelt for when we build things in the future. 

So this won't be a mindless project where you just copy what I do. 

We will only work with content I have already taught or if it is something new I will demonstrate it and provide examples to reinforce new content. I'll use comments for pseudocode.

You might be wondering what "pseudocode" is!

Pseudocode is simple using the human language you are comfortable with, I'll be using english, to write out ahead of time the logic you want your code to follow.

Let's take a glance at the program that we are going to write. 

How Many Jelly Beans in the Jar?

* We will prompt player to enter their name. We will then print their name in a greeting.
* We are going to generate a random between 1 - 500 to be the toal of jelly beans in a jar.
* We want to let the player know how many guesses they have already made before each turn. We will give them a total 10 guesses.
*  Have the player guess the total of jelly beans in the jar.
*  When a player guesses a number too low we will print a message that says, "Nope. That guess is too low!" When a player guesses a number too high we will print a message that says, "Nope, that guess is too high!"
* Allow player to guess until they get it right or run out of turns.
* For a correct guess we will tell them, "Great job, [name]! You guessed the right amount of jelly beans and it only took you [number of guesses], enjoy!"
* If a player takes more than 10 guesses we will tell them, "Sorry, you are out of guesses. The correct answer was [number of guesses] NO jelly beans for you!"

In the following video you can watch me play through a simulation of the game!

In the lesson following that we will start to learn the syntax (language of Ruby) we need to complete this game!
