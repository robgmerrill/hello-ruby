A quick note on course format. Many of the lessons will have a written and video format of the lesson. 

Some people learn best by reading print and like the ease of being able to quickly compare their code with the instructor's code without hitting pause on the video. 

Written text also allows me to be more precise with my word choice in a way that video doesn't always allow. 

However, video is often a great resource to watch someone in action as they program and communicate with you and provide a more detailed description for every click of the keyboard. 

Personally, I tend to enjoy videos when I am just learning something for the first time but once I become familiar with a subject I prefer written articles and documentation as they allow me to code at my own speed and level and deal with specific tasks I'm looking to accomplish. 

If you are new to programming I would actually encourage you to go through both formats for each lesson. Or, possibly if you have a preference for a style but a lesson doesn't really connect with you in one format you might take a look at it in the other format to see if that helps!
