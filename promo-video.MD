Welcome to "Hello Ruby"!

Hi, my name is Rob. I'm a programming teacher based out of Seattle, WA. 

Hello Ruby isn't the only programming course you should ever take on the Ruby Programming language, but it should be your first.

The reason this course is called "Hello Ruby" is because often times the first thing you learn to do in a new programming language or framework is output or display the words "Hello World."

And I hope that this course is the first course you turn to in learning how to accomplish this!

As an instructor it is my job to make learning Ruby as painless as possible. This involves removing as much confusion as possible. 

It means explaining technical words in understandable ways and it means stripping down the tooling to make it as easy as possible for you to get started coding right away.
