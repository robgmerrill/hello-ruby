Welcome to our course, "Hello Ruby"!

Why do we call this course "Hello Ruby"?

Great question!

It is a typical practice that when someone is learning a programming language or framework that one of the first things they try to do is print or output the phrase "Hello World."

As a teacher of programming languages my goal is always to make that task as straightforward as possible. 

Let's be realistic, learning a programming language is going to be hard no matter what. You are literally learning another language. That takes time and practice and a deep commitment of the learner.

I take the responsibility as the teacher of this course to try to remove technical jargon and removing hurdles and industry tools that may work great for industry professionals but only increase the learning curve for beginners.

Are you ready to say "Hello World" in Ruby?

Let's go!
